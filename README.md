# Thrive 🌿  
**Reconnect with Nature.**

Welcome to **Thrive**, a sleek and modern login page designed to inspire mindfulness and connection with nature through minimalist design and clean UI practices. This project showcases my front-end development skills, built using HTML, CSS and Javascript with an emphasis on theme toggling (dark/light mode), and aesthetic, minimilist nature design.
